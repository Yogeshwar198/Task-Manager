## Installation and Setup

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd <filename>
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
4. **Run the application:**
```bash
npm start
```
5. **Open your browser and visit:**
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## Assumptions Made
1. **Local Storage:** The application persists tasks using the browser's local storage. No backend is integrated.
2. **Deadline Management:** The "expired" status is determined solely by comparing the current date with the task deadline.
3. **Responsiveness:** The UI is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes but may need further testing on smaller devices.
4. **Unique Task IDs:** Tasks are assigned unique IDs based on the current timestamp.


## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the UI.
- **React Context API:** For state management.
- **React Icons:** For UI enhancements with icons.
- **React DatePicker:** For deadline selection.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
